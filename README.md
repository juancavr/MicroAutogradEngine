# MicroAutogradEngine
Small project aimed at implementing the foundational building blocks of the PyTorch library from scratch. Our objective was to understand the inner workings of PyTorch by coding essential components such as tensors, automatic differentiation, and basic neural network layers.

Once we had implemented these building blocks, we proceeded to leverage them to construct a simple neural network. This network was designed to tackle straightforward binary classification problems. By employing our custom-built components, we gained valuable insights into how neural networks operate at a fundamental level, deepening our understanding of machine learning concepts.
